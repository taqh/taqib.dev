## Project Overview

Quillstash is an open-source content publishing platform built in collaboration with [Ibrahim](https://ibrahimdoba.vercel.app). Designed to provide a seamless, ad-free writing and reading experience, Quillstash aims to empower writers while fostering an active community. 

Since its launch in September 2024, Quillstash has grown steadily, achieving **over 20,000 page views**, including **3,000 in just the first 30 days**, and now averages **4,000 monthly views**. The platform currently hosts a group of **10 active writers**, and the community is expanding every day.

## Objectives

1. **Simplify Publishing**: Deliver an intuitive and ad-free platform for both readers and writers.
2. **Empower Writers**: Provide tools like AI-powered SEO and OG image generation to help writers amplify their reach.
3. **Foster Community Growth**: Build an inclusive and active community of content creators and readers.

## Features

1. **Dynamic OpenGraph Image Generation**: Automatically generates OG images for each post, featuring the author's name and article title. If the description is omitted, Google's Gemini AI crafts an SEO-optimized one.
2. **Modern, Minimalist UI**: The site is designed to be distraction-free and straightforward, offering a clean user experience compared to most platforms.
3. **Simple Editor**: A no-frills text editor tailored for writers to focus purely on content creation.
4. **Discord Integration**: To build community engagement, Quillstash includes a Discord bot that notifies the server when new articles are published.
5. **SEO Optimization Tools**: Using SEMrush for keyword research ensures writers' content is discoverable and aligned with search trends.

## Challenges & Learning

Building Quillstash taught me invaluable lessons:
- **SEO & Optimization**: Learning the intricacies of keyword research and trend analysis to drive organic growth.
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Implementing systems for real-time OG generation and article management.
- **Community Building**: Strategizing to engage writers and readers beyond just publishing content.

## Outcome

Quillstash has successfully established itself as a modern, full-stack content platform. In just three months:
- **Over 20,000 page views**, with consistent monthly growth.
- **10 active writers**, contributing a diverse array of content.
- A growing Discord community actively engaging with the platform.

## Future Plans
