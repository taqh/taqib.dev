## Project Overview

StashBot is a custom-built support bot for the [Quillstash](https://quillstash.com) Discord server, designed to enhance community engagement and provide real-time AI-powered assistance. By notifying members of newly published articles, StashBot ensures that all authors receive equal attention, fostering a more connected and interactive community. 

Additionally, the integration of Google's Gemini AI brings cutting-edge conversational capabilities directly into the server, offering members quick, AI-driven support and interaction.

## Objectives

1. **Boost Community Engagement**: Notify members about new articles to drive conversations and readership.
2. **Foster Inclusivity**: Ensure every author's work is equally highlighted to promote a supportive environment.
3. **Enhance User Experience**: Provide real-time AI assistance through integrated Gemini-powered slash commands.

## Technology Stack

- [Hono](https://hono.dev): Lightweight Node.js framework for backend logic and API routing.
- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org): Simplifies interaction with the Discord API for bot development.
- [Google's Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api): Powers conversational AI and text generation capabilities.
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org): Ensures type safety and improved code maintainability.

## Challenges & Learning

Developing StashBot taught me:
- **API Integration:** Working with Discord's API and Google's Gemini API improved my skills in handling third-party service integrations.
- **Real-Time Systems:** Building notification systems required efficient logic for real-time updates and alerts.
- **Community Engagement Design:** Crafting features that actively promote inclusivity and collaboration improved my understanding of user-centric design.

## Future Plans

To further enhance StashBotâ€™s functionality, I plan to:

1. **Introduce Writer Leaderboards**: Track published posts per writer and recognize active contributors.
2. **Implement Rewards Systems**: Celebrate milestones with fun announcements, badges, or special roles within the server.
3. **Expand AI Capabilities**: Add more conversational features powered by Gemini to make StashBot a creative partner for writers.
4. **Optimize Performance**: Implement rate limiting and caching mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and prevent API spamming.
