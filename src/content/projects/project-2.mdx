## Project Overview

The **Would You Bot** website app serves as a companion platform for a Discord bot designed to elevate server engagement through features like user voting, daily messages, and server-specific customization.

## My Contributions

I worked primarily on the **Question Packs** feature, which allows users to create, customize, and manage collections of questions for their servers. My contributions included:

- Developing the user interface for question pack management using **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**.
- API integrations for storing, retrieving, searching, filtering and updating question packs.
- Enhancing user interactions with animations and transitions built using **Motion**.

## Technology Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): Leveraged for its full-stack capabilities and server-side rendering features.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com): Used for creating responsive and consistent styling.
- [Motion](https://motion.dev): Utilized for smooth animations and UI transitions.
